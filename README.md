🌍 World Data Excel Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is a deep dive into a world dataset where I put my Excel skills to the test. From cleaning messy raw data to building interactive dashboards, I handled every step myself. The work involved carefully organizing, analyzing, and visualizing global indicators like population and economy.
It wasn’t just about making charts — I focused on using advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables, logical formulas, and slicers to make the analysis both detailed and interactive. The final outcome is a polished Excel dashboard that doesn’t just display data, but tells a clear story about global trends.
